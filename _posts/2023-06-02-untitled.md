Imagining a childhood now is insurmountable. Gun-related violence, attention deficiency, and an odd mix of narcissism and apologeticism leads to my being weighed down by the thought of a smaller, stupider me not being able to navigate a 21st century world.

But I can’t stomach the thought of growing old either. Assisted living, impaired mobility, everything slowly grinding to a resolute halt. Missing out on the sole defining parts of my life – distance running, bike commuting, constantly learning. The thirst for competition and the liver to quench it.

So adrift I float in this self-supported kayak of my current age in the current year. It’s good enough. And certainly I’m glad I’m neither younger nor older.
