harvard square

i picked an inconspicous adirondack seat
facing the center mass in harvard square.
From here I could watch everyone unfold.
Weather was sunny, report said 40s
but I had to disagree.
I knew 40s meant 30s, but I rode my bike
so that meant 40s again. But the sun was out – plus five degrees
but it was windy – minus five.
So i sat in the square, sunglasses on, sunglasses off, jacket zipped, jacket unzipped,
comfortable and uncomfortable in the wooden-plastic adirondack chair.
Here i watched the rest of the world unfold
just as confused as me.
I saw several runners – somehow both faster than me and slower
and bikers too – same idea.
Students smarter and more successful
but still more hopeless at this prestigious school.

Oops. eyes were closed. I opened
and saw center mass in harvard square.
Jackets half-zipped, glasses half-on,
just as confused,lost,hopeless,excited,anxious,confused,melancholic,manic,busy,indolent (those fuckers!),
wondering how 40 degrees really felt.
